## Overview

Enterprise Agile Project Management Platform is a scalable, full-stack web application designed to streamline project execution, team collaboration, and operational tracking within enterprise environments.

The platform enables organizations to manage projects, tasks, roles, priorities, deadlines, and team assignments through an intuitive Kanban-style workflow. It provides structured role-based access control, real-time status tracking, and performance visibility to improve productivity and decision-making.

Upon authentication, the system dynamically controls access to modules and specific actions based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Each user role is granted permissions according to predefined business rules, ensuring secure separation of responsibilities and controlled operational execution.

🔐 Role-Based Access & Module Control

Access to system modules is restricted by role.
Sensitive actions (create, update, delete, assign, approve) are governed by granular permission logic.
The platform enforces security policies at both API and UI levels to prevent unauthorized operations.

Built with a modern tech stack, the system integrates a secure RESTful API, JWT-based authentication, and a relational database architecture optimized for data integrity and scalability. The solution follows clean architecture principles, modular design, and enterprise-grade best practices to ensure maintainability and long-term growth.
