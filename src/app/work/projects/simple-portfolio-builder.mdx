## Overview

RH-App is a full-stack Human Resources Management System designed to streamline employee administration, internal workflows, and organizational data management. The platform was built following enterprise-grade architecture principles, focusing on scalability, modularity, and API-driven integration.

The backend was developed using Java with Spring Boot, implementing RESTful APIs for secure and efficient communication with the frontend. The system handles employee data management, structured routing, and cross-origin configurations for seamless frontend-backend interaction.

On the frontend, a modern React.js application consumes the REST services using Axios, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. The architecture ensures clear separation of concerns, enabling maintainability and future scalability.

🔧 Key Features

- RESTful API architecture
- Employee CRUD operations
- Cross-Origin configuration for secure frontend-backend integration
- Modular controller-based routing
- Error handling and HTTP status management
- Scalable structure for enterprise deployment
