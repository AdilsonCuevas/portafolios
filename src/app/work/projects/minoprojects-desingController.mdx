# Overview

## 1️⃣ Movies Visualization Platform (Full Stack – NestJS + Next.js)

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/AdilsonCuevas/movie_frontend.git
https://github.com/AdilsonCuevas/movie_backend.git

### 📌 Description
A full-stack movie visualization platform that consumes a remote public API and displays data dynamically using paginated queries handled directly by the API.

The backend is built with **NestJS**, exposing secure RESTful endpoints and handling authentication using **JWT**. Tokens are stored securely in cookies using `cookies-js`.  

The frontend is developed in **Next.js**, implementing server-side rendering capabilities and dynamic routing for optimized performance and SEO.

### 🔧 Key Features
- Remote API consumption
- Server-side pagination via query parameters
- JWT authentication
- Secure cookie-based session handling
- RESTful API architecture
- Modular and scalable structure

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- Backend: NestJS
- Frontend: Next.js
- Authentication: JWT
- State Handling: Cookies (cookies-js)
- Architecture: REST API
