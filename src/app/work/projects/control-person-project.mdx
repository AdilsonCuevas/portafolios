## Overview

This Client Registration & Management System was developed as a full-stack enterprise application designed to optimize client onboarding, user assignment, and service workflow management.

The frontend was built using Angular 18, structured with feature-based modules to ensure scalability and maintainability. Dedicated modules were implemented for user creation, client registration, and administrative management. Application state and authentication flow are controlled using NGXS, enabling centralized session management and predictable state transitions.

Unit testing was implemented using Jasmine, ensuring code reliability and maintainable frontend architecture through structured test coverage.

The backend was developed using NestJS following a modular architecture approach. Authentication is handled via JWT, with secure role-based route protection (RBAC) to ensure controlled access to system functionalities.

For data persistence, the system uses MongoDB, with Mongoose as the ODM to manage schema definitions, data validation, and structured document modeling.
